            As a community organization, Team 6036 prides itself in being extremely open: we take anyone who is
            interested in contributing to the technical education of themselves or others in the community, and no time
            commitment is required. This also means that no previous knowledge of anything robotics or management
            related is necessary to join -- you just have to be in high school. That said, few people can jump into
            robotics and learn every aspect of the field without serious time and effort. This is why we have subteams:
            specialized groups of members that work on a specific part of the necessary components of the robot. As a
            team, we are vaguely divided into Software, Build, Design, and Business. Note that you're not forced to be
            in a single one or any of these subteams to contribute, but they are organized and led separately, as their
            tasks are vastly different.

                        The part of the team most detached from the physical robot, the Software subteam's
                        responsibilities
                        include maintaining the website, active codebases (sets of code that the team may reuse), and
                        demo robot's
                        functionality (for sponsors and friendly matches), on top of making sure that the robot
                        designed, funded, and
                        assembled by the rest of the team can actually be used.

                        While learning to coding and computer science are a
                        field of their own, they are essential to robotics. New members with no knowledge are welcome to
                        join this
                        subteam, and will be led through the basics on how the basic tools we use (git, java, wpilib, VS
                        Code) work.

                    <h2> Build </h2>
                    <p>
                        The build subteam is composed of almost everyone on the team. Very few people don't play a role
                        in assembling some
                        portion of the robot, whether it be a gearbox or a flywheel. Of course, this is also the subteam
                        with the greatest
                        workload. Once the designs are finalized, this subteam is in charge of machining the necessary
                        parts, assembling them,
                        being present to help software test their functionality and stability, working around any design
                        flaws, and replacing
                        any broken parts as they wear out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that the machining stage for parts will only be done by members that have been
                        thoroughly trained in the use of whatever given machine is needed. Any member that wants this
                        training will receive it,
                        but they will not be permitted to use the machines (especially the lathe/mills) until cleared.

                    <h2>Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Design subteam is in charge of, as you would assume, designing the robot. They are arguably
                        the most crucial subteam,
                        as if the designs take too long, are too difficult to machine or assemble, are faulty, or do not
                        meet tolerances, the robot
                        simply will not have the capability to perform in a competition. The majority of design's work
                        is done in cad software
                        (Solidworks or Fusion 360), but their role also includes coming up with and proposing to the
                        team what sort of strategy
                        and mechanisms the year's robot will use.

                    <p>
                        Any new members wanting to learn how to cad will be taught to do so and given a
                        license for the software (or shown how to get one), given that their computer meets the
                        software's system requirements
                        (not actually very high for Fusion, but something to consider).

                    <h2>Business</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Business team is the smallest yet most important subteam. If you look at the sponsors list
                        on this site, you will see the product of this subteam. Their job is to acquire money for the
                        team through grants and sponsorships. The yearly cost of entry to the FRC competition is about
                        $6000, which is a huge barrier for a high-school team. On top of this, the cost of the parts in
                        a robot can cost from $3000 to $5000, not counting the machinery, replacement parts, travel
                        expenses, etc. It is the Business subteam's job to fund the whole team throughout the year.
                        Without this subteam and the work they do with sponsors, 6036 would not be a sustainable team,
                        and the community would lose an important source of education.

                Our tools include VS Code, Java, an frc-specific set of codebases that assist us with the more
                nitty-gritty parts of coding, and git among several other less crucial ones. These all have their
                learning curves, and every member is self taught in most or all of them. We know coding is hard, and we
                understand that it might be intimidating for people new to the subject. We're here to help anyone
                interested in learning to find success. Email the software captain at <a

                This is the subteam with the most work, and least material to learn. Outside of the machines and things
                like hammers, mallets, and saws, members of this subteam spend most of their time putting things
                together. That said, there is skill built in assembly and understanding of the complex and interesting
                mechanisms that the design team comes up with, as well as working around their occasional flaws. People
                from all three other subteams tend to also play a role in this one, as it is composed of almost everyone
                in 6036.
