# Team 6036 homepage

Index is root page. Note that pages use site/pageBuilder.js to construct their navbar and contacts section.
If you would like to add to the navbar, see site/nav.json. If you would like to modify the contacts section, see site/contact.html
Site will hold files that are needed globally across the site. The subfolders within site will hold files (mostly images) for their
respective pages.

All pages are to be held in site.
## Unless you mean to change site/pageBuilder.js, do not modify the structure of site/nav.json
